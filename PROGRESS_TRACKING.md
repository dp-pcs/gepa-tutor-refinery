# Progress Tracking - GEPA Tutor Refinery

## Project Overview
**Goal**: Implement a GEPA-style prompt refinement pipeline for AI tutoring that maximizes learning accuracy while controlling cost/latency.

**Core Concept**: Run â†’ Reflect on failures â†’ Propose prompt edits â†’ A/B test â†’ Pareto-select â†’ Iterate

## Current Status
- [x] Repository initialized and pushed to GitHub
- [x] Code structure reviewed and understood
- [x] Progress tracking document created

## Architecture Understanding

### Core Components
1. **Main Loop** (`src/run_loop.py`): Orchestrates the entire pipeline
2. **Evaluator** (`src/evaluator.py`): Runs MCQ evaluations with different strategies
3. **Reflection Engine** (`src/reflect_and_edit.py`): Analyzes failures and proposes prompt edits
4. **Pareto Selection** (`src/pareto.py`): Identifies non-dominated prompt variants
5. **Model Providers** (`src/models/`): Interface with OpenAI, Anthropic, or mock models

### Evaluation Strategies
- **Baseline**: Single-shot tutor prompt

### 5. Advanced Evaluation Strategies

- [x] **Hybrid Approach (SR â†’ GEPA)**: âœ… **FULLY IMPLEMENTED & OPTIMIZED**
  - **Phase 1**: Basic hybrid mode implementation
  - **Phase 2**: Fundamental fixes (prompt tailoring, error recovery, format lock)
  - **Phase 3**: Performance optimization and prompt refinement
    - **3.1**: âœ… **Complete** - Prompt rendering fixes and dataset-specific prompts
    - **3.2**: âœ… **Complete** - Format training examples and error recovery
    - **3.3**: âœ… **Complete** - Intelligent confidence scoring and override logic
    - **3.4**: ðŸ”„ **In Progress** - Performance analysis and threshold optimization
  - **Phase 4**: Advanced features (conditional execution, hybrid variants) - **PLANNED**

### **Phase 3.4: Performance Analysis & Threshold Optimization** ðŸ”„ **IN PROGRESS**
- **Confidence Threshold Optimization**: Raised from 0.35 to 0.5 based on empirical analysis
- **Enhanced Confidence Scoring**: Added strong disagreement language and reasoning structure factors

- **Override Pattern Analysis**: Studying success rates and failure modes
- **Cost per Correct Analysis**: Implementing efficiency metrics

### **Critical Review Findings (Instructions/review_updates.md)**
- **Task Mismatch**: Prompts assume passages exist when they don't (TruthfulQA-MC, LSAT)
- **Format Violations**: GEPA edits breaking format cause 0% accuracy
- **Token Explosion**: Little accuracy gain for high token cost
- **Overfitting**: Dev set edits don't generalize to test set
- **Hybrid Complexity**: Inherits mistakes and multiplies token cost

## Questions & Clarifications Needed

### Technical Questions
1. **Model Integration**: Should we test with real API keys or stick to mock for development?
2. **Dataset Size**: Are the default dataset sizes (30 train, 10 dev, 10 test) sufficient for meaningful evaluation?
3. **Error Handling**: How robust is the current error handling for API failures?

### Business Logic Questions
1. **Prompt Edits**: How many prompt edits per round is optimal? (Currently set to 3)
2. **Reflection Examples**: How many failed examples should be used for reflection? (Currently 20)
3. **Iteration Count**: Should we increase max_rounds beyond 2 for more thorough optimization?

## Issues & Concerns

### Potential Issues Identified
1. **Token Counting**: The evaluator has some complexity around token counting that might be fragile
2. **JSON Parsing**: Reflection responses need to be valid JSON - this could fail silently
3. **Data Validation**: Limited validation of dataset format consistency

### Performance Considerations
1. **API Rate Limits**: Need to handle potential rate limiting gracefully
2. **Cost Management**: No built-in cost tracking or limits
3. **Parallelization**: Currently sequential evaluation - could be slow for large datasets
